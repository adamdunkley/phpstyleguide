Applying the style guidlines from phpstyleguide.com

If you are finding it hard to agree on coding standards for your project, then you should consider [The Definitive PHP Style Guide](http://phpstyleguide.com/)

The guide is short and completely easy to follow, I have formatted an [example controller]() from ZF2 to use this fantastic style guide. I am sure you will see the advantages it brings.

NOTES

I have found that given the conflict between using spaces for indentation and tabs for right aligning comments, you can end up with odd results in comment blocks. At first I was concerned about this but after some consideration I feel it is consistent with the intent of the standards and so have left it in.
